# Casa-De-Masa - A Fictional Restaurant Page

This project is designed to showcase my ability to utilise React to build quick, beautiful and functional websites.

## Timeline

I created the front page for this in approximately an hour of work. I wanted two things - one, to have something more front-end to add to my portfolio to show I can actually design websites, and two, to have something to back up my claim of knowing React.

At the moment, it's just a front page without any actual functionality, but as time goes on I will add to this to have a working back-end, with legitimate (if not honoured) bookings able to be made.
